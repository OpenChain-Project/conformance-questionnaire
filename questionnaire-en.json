  "preambleText": "The OpenChain Project builds trust in open source by making license compliance simpler and more consistent. It maintains the OpenChain Specification to define a core set of requirements every quality compliance program must satisfy. The result is that open source license compliance becomes more predictable, understandable and efficient for participants of the software supply chain.\nThis document contains a series of questions to determine whether a company has an OpenChain Conformant program. If each of these questions can be answered with a \"yes\" then that company meets all the requirements of conformance to the OpenChain Specification version 2.1 (functionally identical to ISO/IEC DIS 5230:2020(e)). If any of the questions are answered with a \"no\" then the company can clearly identify where additional investment is needed to improve the compliance process.",
